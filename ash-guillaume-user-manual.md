## 10 things to know about working with @ashygee

1. **My professional mantra: Approach with curiosity and kindness** What we do is incredibly complex and sometimes there can be a multitude of solutions. But questions are free, having clarity is vital, and approaching with openness and kindness can bring down most defenses so we can do our best work together. 
2. **My personal mantra: Growth is not linear** The path I took to get to where I am is not typical to what is prescribed in our industry. Everyone has their own story and I value and respect mine. I believe that all experiences have led me, and will continue, to lead me to achieve the goals that I set for myself.
3. **I value understanding and am adaptable with communication styles** I strive to communicate clearly and directly but understand that nuance and tone can be lost or assumed sometimes in text communications. I prefer face to face for deeper conversations and also just enjoy chatting as it eases feelings of isolation.
4. **I understand that feelings are processed differently** Having feelings at work can sometimes feel like taboo. I try to honor that the way someone can feel can impact the work and working relationships and do my best to listen to see where any core feelings may be acting affecting the team to move forward. If I am sensing something might feel off I will try to check in with my coworkers to see how we can find resolution and move forward. 
5. **I am a connector** I don't know all of the answers, but chances are I may know a team or someone who can better assist. I think our best work is done when we can harness the strengths and abilities of others so I do my best to find the people who may know best.
6. **I do my best work in the afternoon** I use my mornings to catch up with everything that my teammates on the other side of the world have done or to check any messages I've been pinged on. It takes me a bit to get started but I've found that from just after lunch time until closing (usually 6-7pm ET) is when I do my best work. I've blocked off specific focus time where I can be heads down so please be respectful of those time blocks.
7. **I'm your biggest fan** I get a lot of joy out of supporting and celebrating my teammates. I think everyone deserves to be recognized for their contributions and so I enjoy "shouting from the rooftops" when there's something to be celebrated. Sometimes I joke and call myself the design team's soccer mom. If I could I'd bring orange slices.
8. **I leave no person behind** If we are on a team together, we are a team. I care for and value the people around me and do my best to ensure that I am adding to create a supportive and inclusive culture for our team.
9. **I want to be better** There is always something that I can improve on and I am constantly reflecting on this. Being better is not just for myself but for my team as well. I know that as I am able to shift and grow I can better support those around me. This is what drives my ambition and work ethic.
10. **At the end of the day I'm not perfect** It's hard for me to slow down sometimes and be ok with not having all of the answers. But I know it's not realistic and so I try to be kind to myself, even if it's very hard, and remind myself that it's ok if I'm not. I will make mistakes and I appreciate the patience and support of my teammates to make these iterative corrections.

- üê∂üê± I have two babies in my life. They are my dog, Calvin, and my cat, Biscuits. Sometimes they show up in camera.
